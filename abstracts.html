											<p>Many faculty assign textbook reading prior to their traditional lectures. In this study, we assessed students’ level of class preparedness and surveyed their textbook reading practices weekly along with entrance and exit surveys concerning their attitudes towards reading the textbook. We report that pre-lecture reading is a significant variable in explaining pre-lecture preparedness as well as for exam average. Additionally, we report reasons cited for not reading more of the textbook. We hope this analysis will enable educators to have a better understanding of the level of pre-lecture reading that occurs in a traditional lecture-style classroom and the impacts of pre-lecture reading on student success.</p>

											<p>Unconferences are innovative ways to engage stakeholders and develop talent within a community.  Through participant-driven professional learning, unconference participants will develop a deeper understanding of the issues and solutions they face. During the unconference, attendants will have the opportunity to collaborate, coach and consult with each other. This experience fosters high-quality outcomes and results in a stronger and more deeply networked learning community.</p>

											<p>Unconferences are generally free for attendees, open to all and vendor-free. Unconference sessions are created by participants on the day of the event and are facilitated by anyone. Participants rely on the "rule of two feet" which empowers them to find sessions that meet their needs.</p>

											<p>Join us to learn more about this innovation and how you can easily implement one for your learning community.</p>

											<p>This ice-breaker can be used for any class; it is a creative and fun way for students to use critical thinking as well as presentation skills when introducing themselves to their classmates.</p>

											<p>To facilitate this activity, fill a basket, box, or bag with a variety of things such as small decorative items, playthings, and/or kitchen gadgets, etc.  Bring these things to class and spread them out on a table. As students enter the room, instruct them to select something that appeals to them.  Students are then charged with introducing themselves by describing a few characteristics that they share with the item.  For instance, a student might select a battery and talk about being a high-energy individual.  Another student might select a small ball and talk about being well-rounded and able to bounce back when life presents challenges.  Come experience this teaching strategy.</p>

With hardware check-out systems that exist on many college campuses, and the increase of smart phone use by college students, Mobile learning or M-learning offers an opportunity for students to access course content using personal electronic devices. This work suggests that the use of Quick Response codes (QR codes) offers a digital alternative to discussions in classrooms, review of course material, as well as an opportunity for students to examine each other's work.</p>

											<p>“Story Mapping Changing Neighborhoods” in Washington, D.C.  is a project out of the University of Maryland’s Urban Studies & Planning program that employs web and mobile GIS to facilitate community-engaged data collection, analysis, and presentation. The project centers on five D.C. neighborhoods facing significant demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural change, and the story of those changes as told by long-term residents and community groups. Student researchers used mobile and web GIS applications, along with cognitive mapping methods to engage with current and former long-term residents about their experiences of neighborhood change. Through active “walking” and map-centered interviews, long-term residents shared information about places of highest value to them, the locations of important neighborhood events, their perception of neighborhood identity and boundaries, as well as their experiences of change over time. This data was then assembled into online story maps documenting the residents’ varied perspectives on their changing neighborhoods. While each story map is unique to the neighborhood it represents, the five neighborhood story maps nonetheless share a common experience of anxiety about the changes occurring in their communities, and the potential isolation and displacement of vulnerable long-term residents, businesses, and institutions in the community. The interactive, accessible online format of Story maps provides a forum for an in-depth presentation of and interaction with a diversity of community experiences. In this way, story mapping has the potential to enhance public participation and representation in planning processes.</p>

											<p>Achieving high levels of proficiency in a foreign language is a challenging task for non-native speakers. The University of Maryland Center for Advanced Study of Language (CASL) teamed with the university’s Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) to create a state-of-the art cinematic virtual environment for advanced language training. The 360 video simulates the immersive experience and challenges of being at an embassy party in Moscow, where a learner must actively listen to high-level native speaker conversations in Russian which use realistic diplomatic language (e.g., nuanced conversation on political topics such as immigration). </p>

											<p>The virtual reality prototype was reviewed by a focus group of five UMD Russian language instructors who provided initial feedback on its pedagogic potential. The group appreciated the natural, nuanced language, cultural nonverbal cues, and active listening required by the multi-conversation scenario, a feature not commonly found in pedagogical materials. The instructors found the conversations to be natural, realistic, and very engaging, and offered suggestions on their potential classroom applications. This poster will feature an overview of the prototype, instructor feedback, and a hands-on demo.</p>

										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>Most students who enter college have not developed effective learning or studying techniques. They were successful in high school by memorizing information, instead of obtaining a deep understanding of the material. Our students in the LSAMP Bridge Program were no exception. The Summer Bridge Program for Scientists and Engineers invites about 20 students accepted into the Clark School to participate in a five-week residential summer program that offers them an opportunity to get an early start in undergraduate engineering coursework. During this program, students attended a chemistry pre-requisite course. After their first pre-assessment exam, with a class average of 10% (from students with an average 3.9 cumulative GPA), we realized that these students did not retain what they learned in their respective high school chemistry classes. After teaching our students metacognitive learning strategies, we noticed a significant improvement in their test scores and understanding of difficult chemistry topics.</p>

											<p>Studies show that the best method of learning takes place when individuals actively become involved with understanding, learning, and applying concepts. Biology involves complex ideas and processes and students must be able to use acquired information as they problem solve. In BSCI160, we include interactive activities throughout the course to help students become engaged with important, but difficult biological concepts. As part of the Teaching and Learning Transformation Center’s Elevate Program, sections of BSCI160 have been redesigned with undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) playing an integral role in student engagement and interaction for the past two years. Our LAs provide hands-on interaction with the students in the classroom as they complete the group activities. LAs also help to develop and are provided the opportunity to teach the activities that are used in the group work. For one example, in order to reinforce the concept of phylogenies and avoid comment mistakes and misconceptions when creating evolutionary trees, students were asked to use cladistics tools and thinking to develop a cladogram using the evolution of candy types provided to the students. In this group activity, students were first asked to create charts that helped them to identify shared characteristics found between the different candy “species.” Next, students created a cladogram showing the evolution of their candies. Finally, they were asked to switch their charts with another group and have their peers come up with a cladogram using only that information. Students enjoyed applying their understanding of cladistics as they worked out an analogy between species evolution and candy evolution. Our LAs found by observation and conversation that their students were excited to learn this way.  Through such group activities, students are motivated to explore new ideas, allowing the LAs to identify potential gaps in comprehension of the topic and to help guide their students towards the correct concept.</p>

										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>In Fall 2012, the University of Maryland instituted a new category of courses into the General Education: Scholarship in Practice (SP). SP courses provide students opportunity to complete significant work of a discipline in the context of an academic course. Through scaffolded experiences that include steps of critique, revision, and refinement, students apply the theories and frameworks from the course discipline to produce work that may be published or impact a constituency beyond the scope of the course. The call for courses in this new category has engaged faculty in innovations in course design that expose the work of their discipline in an authentic manner.</p>

											<p>Significant attention has been devoted to development of learning outcome assessment rubrics for students in General Education courses. Yet, it is uncertain whether faculty members are adequately prepared to teach critical behavioral and interpersonal skills that form the backbone of many General Education programs. To address this issue, we formed an ad hoc, cross-campus group of faculty who were invested in teaching teamwork and collaboration skills and used design thinking principles to explore how such teaching could be improved. One outcome was development of a rubric for faculty members to assess their own readiness to teach collaboration skills.</p>

										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>Assessing learning outcomes is an important aspect of course administration. Two key learning outcomes that we focus on in COMM 107, a multi-section oral communication general education course, are related to the development of listening and speaking skills. In our most recent assessment efforts, we use a performance-based pre-test/post-test format to determine the level of listening and speaking skills that students enter the course with and then compare aggregated data from the end of the semester to see what (if any) improvements have been made. In our presentation, we will begin by summarizing the scholarly research on listening and speaking in the oral communication program/basic communication course as well as share past assessment work in multi-section courses, like COMM 107. We will then detail our assessment procedures, which will include a demonstration of the pre-test/post-test items. Next, we will review our data analysis procedures and share preliminary results.  Then we will discuss possible contributions this research makes to oral communication courses as well as the basic communication course. Finally, we will conclude by facilitating a question and answer session with the audience.</p>

										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>Scholarship and practice classes are intended to provide opportunities for students to apply knowledge learned in the classroom and to use critical and creative thinking to apply this to a real-world problem.  These classes require students to take initiatives; to expect and handle criticism and set-backs; to manage deliverables like they will have to in the real world; and to produce an authentic work product that draws on collaboration with fellow students.</p>

											<p>All sounds good, right?</p>

											<p>But, how do you do this in an introductory class of 150 students?  The answer is not:  have lots of TAs.  This presentation will demonstrate how to use the tools in ELMS to deliver and evaluate a semester-long project that gives students an opportunity to make a difference in his or her selected community.  Students create individual blogs to record their own work throughout the semester. The project has 5 steps and students are frequently evaluated by faculty and peers so there is time for self-reflection and improvement. The end result can be amazing! </p>

										</div>
										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>Somewhere between our undying love for podcasts and our constant quest to create memorable learning experiences for students, we stumbled upon an idea: What if we could guide student learning outside of the classroom as a (literal) “voice in their head”?</p>

											<p>Inspired by our friends at the Stanford school, we created two audio experiences to allow students to experiment with new skills and concepts out in the field. Both audio-learning experiences we’ve tried out so far give students practice with ethnographic methods (a key skillset in our field). After each audio adventure, students regroup in the classroom to share and unpack their unique experiences.</p>

											<p>We have deployed these audio-based experiences in various teaching contexts and are excited about how students have engaged with the material. In this session, we will share what we have tried (and learned!) so far and how we got started in creating our audio tracks. We will also cultivate a discussion on how you might use audio-based learning experiences in your courses to get students “tuned in” to learning. </p>

											<p>In this interactive session, participants will learn how to apply the concept of “funds of knowledge” to their classrooms. Funds of knowledge is an approach to diversity and inclusion that utilizes instructors’ and students’ unique backgrounds and experiences to enrich the classroom. However, there are limited resources and information about how to integrate funds of knowledge into collegiate-level curriculum. As a result, we created an interactive online toolkit focused on this perspective, which will allow university instructors to make their class more inclusive. This toolkit functions both as a training space and a collaborative resource site that instructors can draw on to implement inclusive practices in their courses.</p>

											<p>This session will introduce participants to funds of knowledge, encourage them to incorporate the multiple ways of knowing they bring to the classroom, and teach them strategies for drawing on their students’ many funds of knowledge to enhance learning. We will also introduce the toolkit and explain the resources it offers. Finally, participants will workshop a lesson plan to utilize funds of knowledge. </p>

										</div>
										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>With the preparation of teachers turning to a greater emphasis on opportunities to engage in hands-on practice, teacher educators have sought a number of ways to provide novice teachers with experiential learning, including the use of explicit modeling, case studies, examination of classroom video footage, rehearsals of practice with peers, and tutoring, and service learning. However, providing novice teachers with both sufficient support and sustained opportunities for engaging in practice can prove challenging. A recent addition to the tools that teacher educators can leverage to help novices learn to “navigate the rapids” of the complexity of classroom interactions includes the use of student avatars. These avatars can be given learning profiles, classroom contexts can be set, and demands of classroom management can all be adjusted in ways that meet novice teachers where they are, and stretch them in their teaching capabilities. In this panel, three experienced teacher educators from the areas of science education, adolescent literacy and special education, and ESOL (English for speakers of other languages) education, discuss their use of student avatars with novice teachers. We share our approaches to using the avatars, decision-making processes, challenges, and lessons learned, as well as the learning of our novice teachers.</p>

											<p>Experiential learning can be vastly enhanced by bringing the "real deal" into the classroom. Under Armour is one of the most relevant brands in sports, especially at the University of Maryland. For two years, Prof. Oliver Schlake has teamed up with innovation leaders at Under Armour and students from all colleges at UMD to bring new ideas and solutions to the Baltimore-based company. Building a working curriculum has its challenges, some of them unexpected. The session will give interested faculty a forum to discuss what works and what doesn't when working intensively with industry partners. If time allows, all participants can get hands-on experience with one of the prototyping exercises of previous classes.</p>

											<p>“Invest a few moments in thinking. It will pay good interest." While interest earned is important in finance, we want students to know more than calculating right answers to problems. We want them to think critically about interpreting problems, designing solutions and analyzing and evaluating solutions.  We will draw upon six concepts that we will refer to as “intellectual standards” from the Foundation for Critical Thinking.   These are standards that can be used for students to evaluate their own work or critique others’ work.  These standards are, (1) Clarity - Can others understand your point? (2) Precision:  Is your point specific enough?  (3) Relevance:  Do the points connect? (4) Accuracy:  Is the point correct? (5) Depth:  Do you address the complexity of the topic? (6) Breadth:  Do you cover all KEY viewpoints?  These standards will be related to Bloom’s taxonomy.  The presentation will include results of our study that explores the level of student learning in the introductory financial management course.  Two measures of student learning are used to analyze the amount and level of student learning gained in the course—pre- and post-assessments and grading rubrics of financial management project exercises.</p>

										</div>
										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>Since all University of Maryland students take two general education writing courses, it can be useful for faculty across campus to better understand what students learn in those courses and, where possible, to integrate some of those key concepts into informal and formal writing activities in their own courses. Indeed, integrating writing activities and projects into courses, no matter the discipline, can be a way to help students both deepen and demonstrate their learning. Participants in this session, which is led by the director of Maryland’s Professional Writing Program, will examine several key concepts about writing that students learn in their upper-division required writing course. Participants will practice responding to a sample piece of student writing using these concepts and discuss strategies for developing writing activities or creating writing activities that on this learning students are doing in their GenEd required writing courses and, in turn, deepen students’ learning about the disciplinary knowledge and analytical activity in their own courses. Participants will leave this session with detailed language and ideas they can put to use in their own courses to assign, teach, and evaluate writing more effectively.</p>

											<p>The University of Maryland’s Academic Peer Mentor Program (AMP) trains select undergraduates to advance the learning outcomes of their fellow students.  Through coursework and hands-on experience, AMPs learn about the science behind effective teaching and develop the professional skills necessary to support the performance of others.  Working closely with program faculty, AMPs are critical elements of courses designed to create the active learning environments proven to help students learn.  We will describe the features of the program, provide examples of how AMPs have been utilized, and help you brainstorm opportunities to provide more peer support in courses across campus.</p>

										<div class="modal-body">
											<p>University classrooms can offer spaces of student enlightenment and transformation by way of critical engagement and reflection, leading to the deepening of students’ awareness concerning important issues. With the rise of various social justice movements spearheaded by populations whose voices are in need to be heard, the need to equip and empower students with opportunities to effectively engage in conversations regarding diversity is imperative now more than ever. Therefore, using thoughtful reflection and engaged conversation, the presenters will discuss how they have unpacked the concept of diversity in their own classrooms, as well as how these experiences have shaped their identity formation as instructors. In addition, they will discuss the increasingly complex construction of diversity, i.e., in terms of race, gender, class, income, education, sexual orientation, and how this brings another layer of challenges and benefits when integrated in classroom discussions. Attendees of this presentation will be encouraged to offer their own experiences to further shape the discussion.</p>
