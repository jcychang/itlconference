            <h5>Ryan Curtis, Psychology Department</h5>
            <p>This is a workshop within a workshop. Could you use a fun and easy way to create groups for group projects? Could you use a fun and easy way to engage students in online videos? This workshop will teach you how to do both. I use "speed dating" to create groups in PSYC 334, the Psychology of Interpersonal Relationships. Participants in this workshop will learn how speed dating in class can help foster inclusion and excitement for your group projects. We will demonstrate this by forming groups to create a video quiz on ELMS. Video quizzes are quizzes that are embedded within the video itself. We will learn how to create these using My Media, Media Gallery, and Kaltura on ELMS. Each group will create a video quiz in the workshop. We will not only discuss how video quizzes can be used as assessments, but also how students can create their own video quizzes for studying or for class projects.</p>

            <h4>Reshaping Perceptions of Large Lecture Classes</h4>
            <h5>Patricia Alexander, Anish Singh and Hailey Gibbs, Human Development & Quantitative Methodology Department</h5>
            <p>EDHD 201, Learning How to Learn, is a class created to provide UMD undergraduates opportunities to acquire habits of mind and habits of action associated with optimal learning by engaging in experiences that foster those habits. Being taught for the first time as a large enrollment class (100+ students), this innovative course employs a physical structure and pedagogical techniques that seem incompatible with such courses. To support its unique structure and pedagogy, EDHD 201 is being held in Edward St. John Learning and Teaching Center that makes such innovations possible. Due to the experiences being instituted, it is expected that participation in this non-traditional course should challenge students' perceptions of the foundational character of large enrollment classes. To test that assumption, enrolled students complete a pre-assessment exploring their views of the large enrollment classes they have taken, Students' Perceptions of Large Enrollment Classes (S-PLEC). This assessment addresses the four areas of the Fearless Teaching Framework: climate, content, practices, and assessments. At the conclusion of the course, students will again be asked to complete a version of this assessment that not only asks about their perceptions of large enrollment classes in general but about EDHD 201 in particular. </p>
            <p>Because the organization and pedagogy associated with EDHD 201 are aligned with the dimensions of the Fearless Teaching Framework it is expected that the perceptions of large enrollment classes in general and this particular course will differ significantly on all four dimensions of the Framework. For example, efforts are made to ensure that students feel welcomed and their backgrounds and interests reflected in activities and discussions (climate). The content of the course is made personally relevant to students (content), who learn by engaging in well-researched activities (practices). Finally, assessments are constructed to require the application of learnings with well-articulated rubrics to guide performance and self-evaluation.</p>

            <h4>Using Content and Task-based Teaching to Address Grammar More Effectively</h4>
            <h5>Heather Mehrtens, Maryland English Institute (MEI)</h5>
            <p>In many grammar classes, the present-practice-produce, or PPP, method is used; however, research shows that this method does not best develop successful language skills, because it promotes explicit over implicit knowledge (Ellis 1995; Ellis, 2003). In addition, cognitive science shows that there is a clear limit to how much information students can retain from such instruction (Anderson, 2000; Ellis, 2003; Kennedy, 2006). The primary goal of this session is to show attendees how to flip a grammar lesson, i.e. by having students complete grammar tasks in small groups (e.g., by analyzing sentences and texts) to elicit the target (grammatical) structure.</p>

            <h5>Carolyn Fink, Counseling, Higher Education and Special Education Department and Sue Johnston, DIT Learning Technology Design</h5>
            <p>Teaching with ELMS-Canvas means uploading a variety of content into a course space. Without a background in IT and accessibility, it's hard to know what barriers we might unintentionally be putting in place for our students. The Universal Design Online content Inspection Tool (UDOIT) enables instructors and staff to quickly scan an entire ELMS course space, run a simple report, and provide one-touch options for fixing many accessibility issues. We will demonstrate the tool and discuss the experience of addressing the accessibility issues it found.</p>

            <h5>Lindsey Anderson, Melissa Lucas and Communication Department; Toby Egin and Katlin Meissinger, Do Good Institute</h5>
            <p>In 2017 the Oral Communication Program (OCP) and Do Good Institute partnered in multiple ways to enhance the teaching and learning experience on campus. Specifically, we worked together to encourage COMM 107 students to apply for the Do Good Ideas Challenge while also promoting professional development opportunities for instructors (TTK, PTK, and GAs). In our presentation, we will detail this innovative and multi-level relationship to explain how it has benefited both students and instructors on campus. We will also share best practices as we encourage attendees to think about how collaboration with other entities on campus can help them become fearless in their teaching.</p>

            <p>What is the best way to evaluate a student's understanding of design thinking? It is such a collaborative approach that the traditional exam format does not seem appropriate. How might we assess not just what students know, but how well they can apply what they have learned in an ambiguous yet realistic scenario? Join us to hear about the team-based final exam we developed in which students actively demonstrate the processes and tools they have learned in the course to solve a real problem.</p>

            <p>Kaltura is University of Maryland's media storage and delivery platform that allows faculty, staff, and students to create, host, and share video and audio inside the ELMS environment. Kaltura will automatically add captions to uploaded video via the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) feature. This tool tends to be only 70% accurate, which is not acceptable for students with required accommodations. In order to make the captions ADA compliant, it is recommended to review, edit and correct all captions after they are generated. This presentation will walk you through the steps to edit automated captions on your own.</p>

            <h4>Fearless Teaching: A mid-semester evaluation tool</h4>
            <h5>Alice Donlan and Virginia Byrne, Teaching and Learning Transformation Center</h5>
            <p>Last year, the Teaching and Learning Transformation Center (TLTC) unveiled the Fearless Teaching Framework, a conceptual framework that identifies the TLTC's theory of change and definition of effective teaching. Specifically, the TLTC conceptualizes effective teaching as that which attends to excellent classroom climate, course content, teaching practices, and assessment strategies. These four pieces of effective teaching reflect decades of education research and theory (e.g., Hattie & Timperley, 2007; Rowland, 2014; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) and distill that work into constructs that instructors can incorporate into their classrooms.</p>
            <p>As a next step, we are connecting our conceptualization of effective teaching with our evaluation of effective teaching. The research team at the TLTC has constructed a teaching evaluation that is aligned with the Fearless Teaching Framework. In collaboration with education and pedagogical experts on campus, we constructed a short scale to assess students' perceptions of the course climate, content, teaching practices, and assessment, as well as items on basic course functioning. These items were designed to be used mid-semester to gather formative feedback from students.</p>
            <p>We will present psychometric data analysis on two rounds of scale piloting. We will also discuss best practices for student evaluations of teaching.</p>

            <h5>Timothy Pilachowski, Mathematics Department</h5>
            <p>In 2005 the presenter began using Powerpoint to deliver new material in lectures. In 2015, he began incorporating assessments using Turning Technologies' ReponseWare into large lecture formats as a way to increase attendance (from 50% to 80%). In 2017, he further incorporated small group activities to promote active learning, using ResponseWare to give students immediate feedback on their results. The presenter will share insights into best practices for use of this technology, and solicit the best practices of participants. For maximum participation, attendees should have already set up an account with Turning Technologies, and bring a device (smartphone, tablet, laptop) on which they have installed the Responseware app.</p>

            <h4>Brainstorm Your Way to Creative Assignment Topics!</h4>
            <h5>Karen Lamb</h5>
            <p>Students often find the most difficult part of getting started with an assignment is identifying a topic that excites and enthuses them. Brainstorming can help these students generate topics for a speech or English paper, spark ideas for a creative marketing strategy, and even to think of innovative designs for building a robot.</p>
            <p>The premise of brainstorming is that when a large number of ideas and/or suggestions are produced, high-quality solutions will emerge. There are two steps in the brainstorming process. In the creative stage, participants suggest as many ideas as possible in the shortest amount of time; the refrain is quantity over quality. In the evaluative stage, participants eliminate unworkable ideas and prioritize the best ideas.</p>

            <p>Even for teachers who see the benefit of frequent, low-stakes writing assignments to help students synthesize material, it's easy to fall into a rut and ask for the same kinds of writing every week. This session will discuss why it's important to vary the assignments and what the research says about this practice. Participants will come away with lots of ideas for new writing prompts that can be used across the disciplines. Bring your own ideas to share!</p>

            <h4>Encouraging Student Self-Efficacy in a 50 Minute Class Session</h4>
            <h5>Erin Durham, University of Maryland Libraries</h5>
            <p>What activities and materials can be provided in the classroom that will help students reflect on their learning and apply general concepts to their individual assignments? As an instructor of library research sessions, I teach students in single session at the beginning and middle of the semester. Because I only have one class session to give students research tools as they work on their research papers, I strive to make the sessions as useful and relevant as possible. During a portion of the session, students are given time to work on their individual research topics. As I move around the classroom to assist students on their personal projects, it is evident that students some students are able to identify their research needs, and others seem less directed.</p>
            <p>In order to further direct support to students, I implemented a teaching as research intervention to study learning activities that encouraged student self-efficacy in the classroom. By including active learning techniques that encouraged students to reflect on their research progress, I found that the sessions were able to be tailored more directly to the needs of students. During my lightning presentation, I will share three simple active learning interventions I have found to motivate students to take greater autonomy over their learning.</p>

            <p>Many members of our faculty integrate Google Drive and Google Docs as an important tool in the learning process of their students. At first glance, peer-created Google documents are like simple written responses on electronic paper. However, by collecting group responses and creating written or even multimedia comments, the activities will benefit from much of the enthusiasm and communication that can be found in the traditional classroom.</p>

            <h5>Ed Priola and Larisa Cioaca, Institute of Applied Agriculture (75 minute workshop)</h5>
            <p>During this workshop, participants will learn how to use fun improvisational theater exercises as teaching tools in their own classrooms. The presenters will demonstrate five exercises borrowed from improvisational theater that are now being taught in universities around the country. These exercises have been used effectively to teach scores of undergraduate students in multiple sections of INAG110 Oral Communication, a course that meets the Fundamental Studies Oral Communication requirements of the General Education Program at UMD.</p>
            <p>Participants will actively engage in those exercises. In addition, they will learn how to facilitate the exercises in future class sessions to help their students think creatively, listen attentively, and use vivid language and storytelling to communicate effectively, regardless of whether the subject matter is a liberal arts or a STEM course.</p>

            <h5>Catherine VanNetta, Jorge Tello-Campozano, Tara Tanasovich and Vanessa Wagener, Terrapin Teachers</h5>
            <p>Over the course of two semesters with the support of TLTC through an Elevate Fellowship, an instructional team composed of a faculty member and two undergraduate preservice teachers co-designed and co-instructed a Freshman Connection mathematics course. The course redesign had three major goals: (1) promote a multicultural classroom, (2) create a collaborative environment, and (3) increase formative assessment. The two undergraduate teaching assistants were integral in meeting the goals of this redesign. In addition, this teaching model gave the TAs valuable opportunities to engage with the content that they will teach in high school and continue to hone their craft under the careful guidance of the faculty member. This presentation will briefly describe what teaching and learning looked like in this model, as well as the benefits and challenges for the three audiences involved: the faculty member, the two preservice teachers, and the students enrolled in MATH 115.</p>

            <h4>Beyond the Lecture: Strategies to Engage Students, Model Professional Skills and Promote Student Learning</h4>
            <h5>Theresa Nebel Robinson, Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership Department</h5>
            <p>"Student engagement is the product of motivation and active learning... " shares Elizabeth F. Barkley, author of Student Engagement Techniques: A Handbook for College Faculty. As facilitators for student learning and models of professional skills, instructors in higher education must incorporate effective learning strategies that engage students in learning and take them beyond the mere acquisition of concepts and ideas.</p>
            <p>In 2001, Lorin W Anderson and David R Krathwohl worked with a team to revise the cognitive domains outlined by Benjamin Bloom in his Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. The overview includes the facets of remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate and create for use in learning, teaching, and assessment. These revisions also allow for the extension of Bloom's Taxonomy beyond determining teaching objectives to the inclusion of methods for learning and assessment for student success.</p>
            <p>Incorporating the ACME approach to course planning, we will identify effective practices for incorporating Analysis, Collaboration, Movement, and Explanation to university classes for a more intensive approach to student learning. Through the focus on purposeful planning that encourages student motivation and active learning we will: examine 3-4 instructional strategies for each ACME domain; discuss methods for application of ACME within varied subjects; consider effective planning models for course progression.</p>

            <h5>Omer Preminger, Linguistics Department</h5>
            <p>Using a relatively inexpensive piece of software, anyone with a Windows- or iOS-based tablet can use their tablet as a wireless virtual whiteboard in any classroom with the most basic VGA or HDMI projection capabilities. This provides several advantages when compared with more traditional alternatives. First, the instructor is no longer "tethered" to the front of the class / lecture hall; you can write on the board while walking around the classroom. Second, the instructor can "rewind" (or "fast forward") the whiteboard so that, for example, if a student asks a question about something that was on the board earlier and no longer is, the instructor can rewind the board back to that point in the class, and then fast-forward back to where they were once they're done addressing the issue. Third, at the end of the session, the instructor can seamlessly provide the students with a PDF of everything that was on the board throughout the class.</p>

            <p>The use of think-pair-share in the large lecture can present challenges when it comes to the "share" portion, if you want students to share with the class as a while. Three techniques can be thought of as the "Phil Donahue" where the faculty member walks out into the room and hands a microphone to a student, the "Richard Dawson" where the student tells their answer to the faculty member and the faculty member repeats it to the class, and the "Catchbox" where the faculty member (or other students) toss a throwable microphone to a student. We will quickly experience and discuss each of them, and learn about some student opinions, in this lightning round session.</p>

            <h5>Junjie Su, RH Smith Office of Transformational Learning</h5>
            <p>Given that students' sense of "belongingness" is a strong indicator of their success in college (Freeman et al., 2007; Johnson et al., 2007; Strayhorn, 2012; Yorke, 2016), we examined whether there was anything that instructors could do to promote this sense of "belongingness" in college students. We asked college students (N = 261) to rate their instructor's behavior after recalling either a favorite or a least favorite class, and also asked them to rate their perceived sense of "belongingness". Consistent with our expectations, we found evidence supporting the claim that patterns (profiles) of instructor behavior is positively correlated with students' sense of "belongingness". However, we also found that the relationship between instructors' behavioral profiles and students' sense of "belongingness" is moderated by student demographic variables, such as their race, gender, and year of study.</p>

            <p>Given recent national conversations about student activism and the politics of higher education, we expect that the topic of this panel will draw considerable interest. Though our own perspectives are grounded in Women's Studies, faculty, graduate students, administrators, and instructional staff from across the campus are likely to be interested in discussing the intersections of teaching, learning, and social change. After sharing our own experiences and ideas we will open up a significant portion of the panel to the audience so that they can ask questions and also think about the possibilities for enacting activism assignments in their own classes. Our individual presentations will engage the audience through concrete suggestions and examples of activism assignments while also making space for theoretical considerations about the politics of knowledge and social movement praxis. We will invite attendees to discuss with one another as well as the presenters in order to foster a conversation that will live beyond this one-day event. Our goal is to contribute to the practice of socially-engaged teaching and learning across the UMD community.</p>

            <h4>Teaching Students to Recognize Systemic Racism in Archives</h4>
            <h5>Cecelia Vetter, Laura Cleary and Ashleigh Coren, University of Maryland Libraries</h5>
            <p>As the Instruction Team at a special collections library we provide one-shot instruction sessions to undergraduate classes and teach students how to analyze and incorporate primary sources into their research papers. Building on our students' growing awareness of civil unrest in the United States, we incorporated discussions of historical and archival bias, which help students think critically about archival holdings and historical research.</p>
            <p>In class students conduct a document analysis, attempt to define the historical context in which the object exists, and to consider racism, sexism or other types of prejudice that might influence the creation of the object. We question how secondary sources may represent biased narratives and that by exploring primary sources, students can find historically silenced voices. Additionally, archivists and librarians experience implicit bias, which impacts item selection and description. Working through these questions, students learn the processes that lead to the underrepresentation of minority voices in archival collections. Students then propose ways to remedy past mistakes and improve the representation of minority voices.</p>
            <p>We have experienced successes and challenges engaging students in these conversations. This poster examines our experience and dissects our processes for implementing discussions of systemic and implicit bias into our classes.</p>

            <h4>Using Twitter to Assess Campus Climate after a Hate Crime</h4>
            <h5>Bridget L. Higginbotham, School of Public Health; Virginia Byrne, Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership; and Alice Donlan, Teaching and Learning Transformation Center</h5>
            <p>After the racially-motivated murder of Lt. Richard Collins III, students used Twitter to share personal experiences of being afraid on campus. This study analyzed publicly available tweets to see where (e.g., classrooms) and with whom (e.g., instructors, peers) people experienced instances in which they did not feel safe.</p>
            <p>The first and second authors collected tweets from public accounts that tweeted using the hashtag #FearTheTurtle during May or June 2017. We reviewed the 785 relevant tweets and inductively coded them as opinions vs. personal experiences. We inductively coded the experience tweets (N=225) in up to two emergent categories that represented experiences with bias-related activities in an academic setting (N = 66), with police (N = 30), with peers or in social settings (N = 32), on campus (N = 63), and other (N= 53). Our Cohen's kappa was .761. We discussed all differences and came to agreement on all codes.</p>
            <p>Our approach to hearing and amplifying the voices of marginalized students contributes to how educational institutions might consider social media analysis to understand student sense of safety and belonging. This analysis provides campus leaders with insight into where on campus students experience undue stress and instances of bias.</p>

            <h4>Creatively Learning Biological Concepts: It's all in your mind</h4>
            <h5>Candace Williams, Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences and Marcia Shofner, Entomology Department</h5>
            <p>Growth and fixed mindset studies have shown that students who actively engage in their own learning have an enhanced understanding of course concepts and maximize their academic success. At the University of Maryland College Park, the Academic Peer Mentoring Program (AMP) encourages such active learning and has been implemented in numerous courses. Specifically, this research study analyzes the survey data for a positive or negative student response towards the AMP program, called Learning Activity (LA) program in BSCI 160, for the Fall 2017 semester. This research study also attempts to identify individual students with the growth and fixed mindset and determine how the LA program may influence them.</p>

            <h5>Liana Kaplan, Catherine Butz and Malachi Perez, FIRE</h5>
            <p>The FIRE program, or First-year Innovative Research Experience Program, has been giving students valuable research training in various labs across all spans of science. In the Evolution of Sex Differences lab, students are constantly being taught and tested on a multitude of lab techniques, from pipetting accurately, to running and interpreting a PCR. As peer mentors, we are on our second year in the FIRE program, and have been trained to teach and educate the students how to properly execute daily lab procedures. Training and evaluating the students on the various research guides, provided to us by our research educator, is our main role as peer educators.</p>

            <h4>Forget the Textbook: empowering students to become independent vocabulary learners</h4>
            <h5>Heather Mehrtens, Maryland English Institute (MEI)</h5>
            <p>It is undeniable that every language learner wants to improve his or her vocabulary and that almost every ESL teacher has run into a situation in which his or her students have asked "how can I improve my vocabulary?" The problem is often that there is a different answer for each student. This session will share a vocabulary elective which was taught by different instructors in order to address this issue. When asked to teach this course, instructors were confronted with a situation where students would come from different levels and backgrounds and all needed to improve their vocabulary. To best address this problem, a course was created to teach vocabulary learning strategies instead of a specific list of words. Online and print sources as well as vocabulary size tests were used as the basis of the course and students were taught strategies to improve their vocabulary.</p>

            <h4>Unconference: build a strong learning community through participant-driven professional development</h4>
            <h5>Natalie Janiszewski and Melanee Bryant, R.H. Smith Office of Transformational Learning</h5>
            <p>Unlike traditional conferences, which have schedules set months in advance by the people running the convention, an unconference has an agenda that is created by the participants at the start of the event. Instead of presentations, people are encouraged to have discussions and hands-on sessions. Built on principles of connected and participatory learning, unconferences strive to bring participants together to talk about the things that matter most to them: their interests, passions, and questions. Unconference attendees can choose to lead sessions on those things that matter, with an expectation that the people in the room will work together to build understanding by sharing their own knowledge and questions. Unconferences are free for participants and reliant on the "rule of two feet" that empowers everyone to find sessions that meet their needs.</p>

            <h4>Redesigning Classes to Promote Student Learning and Positive Perceptions of Science Through Active Learning</h4>
            <h5>Sara Lombardi, Biology Department</h5>
            <p>Impact of class size on student learning is a topic of broad interest, but predominantly focus on small class sizes (15-30 students) in public K-12 settings. Few studies focus on differences between medium to large classes (50-300 student) in higher education setting. Often, the differences in learning gains between truly large and small classes are attributed to the learning difference due to the activities in the classroom -- smaller classes are more conducive to active learning and student-centric learning. The goal of our research is to assess the impact of class size when controlling for curriculum and instructor across a range of student class sizes. This is an important piece of information as "at risk" students benefit more from small class sizes Therefore, if the benefits of small classes can be achieved while still maintaining large class sizes, which can be necessary at large universities, it can have wide-ranging implications to a variety of courses across institutions.</p>

            <h4>Real-time Data Improves Climate Literacy of Middle and High Schoolers</h4>
            <h5>Emily B. Starobin, Environmental Science and Policy</h5>
            <p>Local real-time data is a valuable tool in cultivating a climate and data literate student population. Classroom activities that incorporate real-time data (RTD) engage students in ocean science in a way that increases subject relevance and fosters environmental stewardship. Moreover, these activities invite students to interact with data like scientists by asking questions, analyzing data, and engaging in arguments from evidence. As such, they are instrumental in supporting Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs) outlined in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).
            Unfortunately, non-expert audiences such as teachers are not able to take full advantage of these RTD resources. The present project focuses on the development of detailed, place-based lesson plans for middle and high school teachers to facilitate classroom use of oceanic real-time data. The lesson plans utilize online data portals such as the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) Central Data Management Office to demonstrate important ocean science principles. Content areas covered by these lesson plans range from hurricane indicators, both oceanographic and atmospheric to the coastal daily winds and rains phenomenon.</p>
            <p>Climate science teachers must be better equipped with clear, flexible, and user-friendly educational materials to feel comfortable using local real-time data in the classroom.</p>

            <h4>Increasing Student Engagement and Getting Rid of Swag with Clickers</h4>
            <h5>Evan Golub, Computer Science Department</h5>
            <p>When using clickers in the classroom, there are ways to try to spice things up a bit to help students truly engage in the activity. In this lightning round session, we explore two. The first is the use of questions where students are more likely to have a strong opinion and differences in opinion are likely. The second is the use of the "fast fingers" option and random swag you have leftover from projects or conferences to add some fun to asking questions that have a right answer. Both will be presented within the context of an introductory computer science course, but the examples are meant to inspire ideas across disciplines.</p>

            <p>University Learning Assistant (ULA) led weekly review sessions seek to improve student learning by alternative learning strategies. These strategies include reinforced student collaboration, interactive practice problems and small group work. The format of the review sessions is similar to that of a Guided Study Session model, but differs in the way that it is constantly adjusting to the student's content concerns. Over the course of two semesters, data has been collected to evaluate the effect of the review sessions on student learning. For this study, student learning is measured by looking at exam scores/grades.</p>
